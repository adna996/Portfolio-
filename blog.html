					<p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p><br>

					<p>What exactly can you use Python for?

					<p>
						 Web development is the umbrella term for conceptualizing, creating, deploying and operating web applications and application programming interfaces for the Web. Python can be used to build server-side web applications. While a web framework is not required to build web apps, it's rare that developers would not use existing open source libraries to speed up their progress in getting their application working.

					<p>
						 There are popular machine learning libraries and frameworks for Python.If you’re just getting started with a machine learning project, I would recommend that you first start with scikit-learn. If you start running into efficiency issues, then I would start looking into TensorFlow. If you are asking yourself "How should I learn machine learning?" here is solution for that.

						Scripting
					</h2>
					<p>
						 One of the most important skills you need to build as a Python developer is to be able to run Python scripts and code. This is going to be the only way for you to know if your code works as you planned. It’s even the only way of knowing if your code works at all! Scripts are always processed by some kind of interpreter, which is responsible for executing each command sequentially. A plain text file containing Python code that is intended to be directly executed by the user is usually called script, which is an informal term that means top-level program file. For more you can watch video bellow.

					A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.To get you started, let’s first take a deep dive into Search and Sort, two classes of algorithms you can’t live without.<p>
					<ul>
						<li class="post2link">
							<a href="#Searching">
							Searching </a>
						</li>
						<li class="post2link">
							<a href="#Sorting">
							Sorting</a>
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<h2 id="Searching">
						Searching
					</h2>
					<p>
						Roughly speaking, there are two categories of search algorithms you’ll need to know right away: linear and binary.
						The linear and binary algorithms are named as such to describe how long (time complexity) a search is going to take based on the size of the input that is being search.In short, linear = simple.So let's complicate things. What is binary search? Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.</p>
					<h2 id="Sorting">
						Sorting
					</h2>
					<p>
						<table id="blogtabela">
							<tr>
								<th>Sorting Algorithms</th>
								<th>Best Time Complexity</th>
								<th>Average Time Complexity</th>
								<th>Worst Time Complexity</th>
								<th>Space Complexity</th>
								<th>Stable?</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>QuickSort</td>
								<td>O(logN)</td>
								<td>O(NlogN)</td>
								<td>O(N²)</td>
								<td>logN or N</td>
								<td>NO</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>MergeSort</td>
								<td>O(NlogN)</td>
								<td>O(NlogN)</td>
								<td>O(NlogN)</td>
								<td>O(N)</td>
								<td>YES</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>InsertionSort</td>
								<td>O(N)</td>
								<td>O(N²)</td>
								<td>O(N²)</td>
								<td>O(1)</td>
								<td>YES</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>HeapSort</td>
								<td>O(NlogN)</td>
								<td>O(NlogN)</td>
								<td>O(NlogN)</td>
								<td>O(1)</td>
								<td>NO</td>
							</tr>
						</table><br/>
						When choosing a sorting algorithm to use, weigh these factors. For example, quicksort is a very fast algorithm but can be pretty tricky to implement; bubble sort is a slow algorithm but is very easy to implement. To sort small sets of data, bubble sort may be a better option since it can be implemented quickly, but for larger datasets, the speedup from quicksort might be worth the trouble implementing the algorithm.<br>

					<h2>DATA STRUCTURES</h2>
					<p>
						<img src="slike/strukture.png" id="slikaDS"><br>
						A data structure is a way of organizing the data so that the data can be used efficiently. We have to know the difference
						between linear and non-linear data structurres.
						A data strucutre is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence or a linear lisr(array, linked list,etc). Non-linear structure  is said to be if traversal of nodes is nonlinear in nature(grap, trees, etc). 
						<br>
						I have to note that an array is the most fundamental data structure, which stores elements at a contiguous memory location. A linked list is another common data structure that complements the array structure. Similar to the array, it is also a linear data structure adn stores elements in a linear fashion. 
						Some of the real-time applications of Data Structures are:
						<ol>
							<li>For representing a city region telephone network.
</li>
							<li>To implement back functionality in the internet web browser.
</li>
							<li>To store dynamically growing data which is accessed very frequently, based upon a key value.
</li>
							<li>To implement the undo function in a text editor.
</li>
							<li>To store information about the directories and files in a system.
</li>
						</ol>
