      <h3>About HANGMAN</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- Link za dio teksta :

         -->
        Hangman is a word guessing game in which you must guess word as you 
        can faster. If the woord is correct the game is over and yeees, the 
        guesser wins. On the other hand, if player makes enough incorrect guesses 
        theh he is the loser. Firstly, hangamn was paper and pencil guessing game for 
        two or more players. But now we can find this game online and play it. 
      </p><br/>

      <h3>How I made it?</h3>
      <p>
        Firstly, I created this game in Python programing language. I used basic methods for creating. I createed several categories for guessing (such as
        music, movies, cities, and much more). All of these categories were filled 
        with words (separately). After that I created guessing form, where user have to input letter. If the input is correct than the letter is placed where it 
        should be. But if the input isn't correct than the program begins with drawing. With every incorrect input the program  draws line by line. If the word is correct than the program prints a message "Congratulations!You are the winner!". On the other hand message is "Oppps :( you last this game. Do you want to play again?"

      <h2>CONVEX HULL ALGORITHMS</h2> <br/>
      <h3>What is convex hull alogrithm?</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- Link za dio teksta preuzet sa interneta:

         -->
        The concept of convex hull algorithms is intuitive. We have a set P of n points. We want to calculate somthing called convex hull of set P. So, Convex Hull is the line completely enclosing a set of points in a plane so that there are no concavities in the line. More formally, we can describe it as the smallest convex polygon which encloses a set of points such that each point in the set lies within the polygon or on its perimeter. 
        There is few algorithm who can solve this problem but the most common are:
        <ul>
          <li>Gift wrapping</li>
          <li>Quickhull alogirthm</li>
          <li>Jarvis March alogrithm</li>
          <li>Graham Scan algorithm</li>
          <li>Chan's algorithm.</li>
        </ul>
        I have worked on Graham scan, Chan's  and Jarvis algorithms. Here you can find my implementation for these algorithms.
